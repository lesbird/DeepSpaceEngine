# DeepSpaceEngine

A C# / OpenGL space-exploration engine built for **true-scale distances** — billions of
procedurally-generated star systems, light-years apart, with seamless transitions from
interstellar flight down to standing on a planet. See the full design in
[`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md).

> **Status: Milestones M0–M4 complete.** Window + GL 4.1 context, the hierarchical
> coordinate system, a free-fly camera, a streaming procedural **star field**,
> **spawnable solar systems**, and now **landable planets**. Fly within 0.5 ly of a star
> and its deterministic system materialises (emissive sun, lit Keplerian-orbiting planets +
> moons, orbit rings). Approach a rocky planet and it switches to a **cube-sphere quadtree
> LOD terrain** generated from noise — descend all the way to the surface with no jitter
> (per-patch floating origin), and the camera rides the planet's orbital frame so it doesn't
> get left behind by time-lapse. The terrain layers **fBm continents**, **domain-warped
> ridged-multifractal mountains**, and **band-limited detail roughness** (octaves clamped to
> each LOD patch, so it's rugged up close yet alias-free from orbit). The LOD is **smooth**:
> detail **fades in continuously** (fractional octaves) and patches **geomorph** toward their
> parent between levels, so the surface no longer visibly rebuilds itself as you descend or skim.
> Together they give dramatic ranges and canyons, with **slope-aware colouring** (cliffs read as bare rock, snow only on gentle
> highlands) and per-type silhouettes. Ocean worlds get a **rugged sea floor under a translucent
> water surface** — coastlines, sandy beaches, depth-shaded shallows, and a sun glint, all from
> the land simply piercing a flat sea. Planets carry **real volumetric atmospheres** — a
> fullscreen pass ray-marches Rayleigh + Mie
> scattering, so the sky glows on the limb from space and turns blue overhead / hazy at the
> horizon / red toward the terminator on the surface. The atmosphere's **colour and thickness now
> derive from the scanned chemistry**: the scale height follows the mean molecular mass (heavy CO₂
> sits low and tight, light H₂ puffs up), Rayleigh strength tracks gas refractivity, absorbing gases
> tint the sky (methane → cyan), and haze gases + suspended surface dust add a Mie layer (iron-oxide
> red, silica tan, sulphurous yellow) — so a dusty high-CO₂ desert reads tan, a methane ice world
> cyan, and a clean N₂/O₂ world Earth-blue. A live **tuning HUD** exposes the
> atmosphere, relief, and biome knobs and saves them to `tuning.json`. Once you're low over a
> surface, press **R** to deploy a **drivable rover**: an arcade-grounded vehicle with real
> per-planet gravity that follows the terrain, tilts onto slopes, falls off ledges and lands — riding a
> **damped per-wheel suspension** that rests on a collision mesh of the drawn surface and lets each
> wheel travel independently — driven with throttle/steer under a third-person chase camera; press **R**
> again to lift back into free-fly. Deep space is no longer black — a **distant-galaxy backdrop** (a far-field star
> dome plus a glowing Milky-Way band with dust lanes and a central bulge) sits behind the streamed
> stars, and a **proximity speed limiter** keeps interstellar cruising unlimited yet smoothly reels
> your speed in well before you reach a star — gently, on a dedicated star approach rate, so you ease in
> instead of zipping past — and tighter still as you approach its planets and moons (far from everything
> there's no limit at all). Terrain
> patches now **bake on a background worker pool**, with only the GPU upload left on the render
> thread, so descending toward a surface stays smooth instead of stalling the frame. The foreground
> star field is an **unbounded, distance-paged lattice of star blocks** — blocks generate around the
> camera and page out behind it, so the catalog scales to **billions of stars** with only a few
> million resident, each carrying a stable catalog number you can **search and jump straight to** (any
> block loads on demand). When a system is active the sun keeps a bright **glow** so the star still
> reads from across the system, and the **entire HUD toggles off with `H`** for a clean view.
> Generation is fully deterministic. M5 (fidelity) is underway.

## Tech stack

- **.NET 7** (targets `net7.0`; the plan calls for net8 LTS — a one-line change in
  `Directory.Build.props` once that SDK is installed)
- **Silk.NET 2.23.0** — OpenGL, windowing (GLFW), input, and `Vector3D<double>` math
- **OpenGL 4.1 core** — the cross-platform baseline that also runs on macOS (no compute
  shaders; procedural generation is CPU-side)
- **ImGui.NET** — debug HUD
- All NuGet versions are pinned exactly (no floating versions).

## Project layout

| Project | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `Engine.Core` | `UniversePosition` (hierarchical coords), deterministic hashing/RNG, math constants |
| `Engine.Rendering` | GL wrappers: `Shader`, `Mesh`, `Camera`, `Primitives`, matrix helpers |
| `Engine.Platform` | `GameWindow` — Silk.NET window + GL context + input bootstrap |
| `Game.Universe` | procedural generation: galaxy, the **tiled star lattice** — `StarCatalog` (one indexed block), `StarCatalogPager` (loads/evicts blocks around the camera, the `INearestStar` source) and `StarId` (packs the global, invertible catalog id); `StarField` is the legacy infinite cell-streamer; the `BackdropStars` far-field dome, `SystemGenerator` (planets + moons), `Noise` (fBm + ridged), `PlanetTerrain`, atmospheres, the `Rover` surface-physics sim, and the live knobs (`TerrainTuning`/`BiomeTuning` globals + `PlanetTuning` per-type overrides) |
| `Game.Systems` | runtime systems: `SolarSystemManager` (spawn/despawn lifecycle, sim time) and `SpeedPolicy` (the free-fly proximity speed limiter) |
| `Game.App` | entry point, main loop, `FreeFlyController` + `RoverController` (chase-cam driving), renderers (`StarRenderer`, `GalaxyBackdrop`, `SystemRenderer`, `PlanetTerrainRenderer` — patches baked on a background worker pool, uploaded on the render thread, `RoverRenderer`, depth-aware `AtmosphereRenderer` over a `SceneFramebuffer`), `StarOverlay`, HUD + tuning panel (`TuningConfig` save/load) |
| `Engine.Core.Tests` | xUnit tests: coordinate precision, generation determinism, terrain, rover, backdrop & speed policy |

## The core idea: precision at any distance

A single `double` resolves to only ~hundreds of km at galactic scale. `UniversePosition`
instead stores `Sector` (an `Int64` cube index per axis, sector = 1 AU) plus a `double`
`Local` offset within that sector. The fractional position always lives inside a small
sector, so the double's full precision yields **sub-millimetre resolution everywhere**, with
effectively unlimited range. Nothing absolute is ever sent to the GPU — `ToCameraRelative`
produces a small, precise float vector relative to the camera (floating origin).

## Build & run

```sh
dotnet build                       # build everything
dotnet test                        # run the coordinate/hashing test suite
dotnet run --project Game.App      # launch the engine
```

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Mouse | Look — true 6-DOF, no pitch limit / no gimbal lock |
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Move forward / left / back / right |
| `Q` / `E` | Roll left / right |
| Mouse wheel | Speed — sets a logarithmic *desired* speed (1 m/s → ~100 ly/s); the proximity limiter clamps it automatically near bodies |
| `,` / `.` | Orbit time-lapse slower / faster |
| `P` | Pause / resume orbital time |
| `F` | Toggle the body scanner panel |
| `R` | Drive the rover (when low over a surface) / return to free-fly |
| `H` | Toggle the entire HUD (reticles + all panels) on/off |
| `Tab` | Toggle mouse capture (to interact with the HUD) |
| `Esc` | Quit |

There is no dedicated up/down key — 6-DOF flight is achieved by pointing where you want with the
mouse (and rolling with `Q`/`E`) and thrusting forward.

**Rover (driving).** Fly within ~2 km of a solid surface and press `R` to drop a rover onto the
ground beneath you under a chase camera.

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `W` / `S` | Throttle forward / reverse |
| `A` / `D` | Steer left / right |
| `Space` | Brake |
| Mouse | Orbit the chase camera around the rover |
| `R` | Lift back into free-fly from where you parked |

The rover has real per-planet gravity, hugs the terrain and tilts onto slopes, and goes airborne
off ledges until it lands. It rests on a **collision mesh of the actual drawn triangles** (each leaf
patch keeps its CPU-side vertex heights and the geomorph it was drawn with), so it sits exactly on the
visible surface — no sinking into / floating above the mesh, and no LOD-feedback bounce — and **sticks
to the ground** over crests and dips. On top of that it rides a **damped per-wheel suspension**: each
wheel travels independently in its well while the chassis bobs and rocks, settling springily without
ever bouncing back off the ground.

**Proximity speed.** The wheel always sets a single *desired* speed — logarithmic, from 1 m/s up to
~100 ly/s. Your actual speed is that value clamped by a **proximity limiter** that depends only on how
close you are to a body: far from everything there is **no limit** (cruise the galaxy at full speed),
but as you approach a star your top speed is smoothly reeled in, and tighter still as you near its
planets and moons — so you decelerate into an approach instead of blasting past. The slowdown is
*self-converging*: the cap is proportional to your distance from the nearest surface, so each second
covers a fraction of the remaining distance rather than overshooting, and it rises continuously back
to "unlimited" at the edge of a body's zone (no speed cliff). A per-frame anti-tunnelling clamp means
even at extreme speed (or a low frame-rate) you can never skip straight through a body. To ease below
the automatic limit for a fine descent, just wheel the desired speed down; the HUD shows the current
speed and flags when the limiter is holding you below what the wheel commands.

**Navigation aids.** In open space, nearby stars carry reticles (catalog number + class +
distance) and a green arrow always points to the nearest star. Inside a system the star
clutter drops away: the sun is marked, each planet shows its `STAR-PLANET` designation, and
a planet's moons (`STAR-PLANET-MOON`) only reveal once you fly close to it. A "nearest
planet" arrow guides you in. Catalog numbers are plain decimal indices into the star catalog
(star `42`, planet `42-1`, moon `42-1-3`).

**Find a star.** The HUD's *Find star* box takes a catalog number — type it and press *Find* to flag
that star with an amber target marker (on-screen brackets, or an edge arrow when it's off-screen or
behind you), then *Go to it* to jump the camera in to frame it within system-spawn range. Every star
in the lattice is addressable: the id encodes its block, so finding one **loads that block on demand**
even if it's nowhere near you. Stars in the home block keep the small numbers `0 … N-1`.

**Scanner.** Press `F` to toggle a scanner panel that reads out the nearest body once you're in
range — class, radius, surface gravity, temperature, hydrosphere, surface pressure, and
atmosphere/surface composition (works for planets and moons alike), with habitable worlds flagged.
The composition is the **same data that drives the atmosphere's appearance**, so the sky you see
matches the gases (and pressure) the scanner reports.

**HUD.** Shows sector/local position, distance from origin (ly), speed, FPS, the active
system (planets, moons, orbit time-lapse with apparent speed in `c`), and — when landing —
your altitude and live terrain patch counts. Fly to extreme distances to confirm there is
**no positional jitter**.

**Tuning panel.** A second HUD window with live controls for the **star field** (catalog
brightness, perceptual falloff/gamma, and point size), the **galaxy backdrop** (an on/off
toggle plus band-glow and distant-star brightness), the **atmosphere** (an on/off
toggle, plus sun intensity, exposure, Rayleigh/Mie strength, haze anisotropy, shell height —
and a *Debug: transmittance* toggle that shows the ray-march geometry), **terrain relief**
(relief scale, mountain bias, feature frequency), **surface detail** (LOD distance — how aggressively
the terrain subdivides on approach — plus detail-normal strength/fineness/range and material breakup),
and **biome/colour** (snow line, cliff threshold and strength, lowland tint, rock/snow/cliff colours).
Atmosphere updates instantly;
terrain/biome changes regenerate the meshes live. Turning the atmosphere off renders the bare
surface — handy for inspecting terrain.

The terrain/biome controls edit either the **global defaults** or a **per-planet-type override**:
pick a type (it auto-follows the world you fly down to), tick *Override for &lt;type&gt;*, and that
type carries its own palette/relief — e.g. jagged red lava worlds vs. smooth pale ice worlds —
while every type without an override keeps the global look.

**Save settings** writes everything (globals + enabled overrides) to `tuning.json` (next to
`imgui.ini`), which auto-loads on the next launch — so a look you dial in becomes the new default.
Defaults are neutral, so generation stays deterministic until you turn a knob.

## Roadmap

- **M0 — Foundation** ✅ window, coords + tests, free-fly camera, debug scene
- **M1 — Star field & true scale** ✅ procedural galaxy, point-sprite star rendering, cell streaming, nearest-star HUD, on-screen reticles + nearest-star navigation arrow
- **M2 — Solar systems** ✅ deterministic system generation, spawn/despawn at 0.5 ly (hysteresis), emissive sun + lit orbiting planets + orbit rings
- **M3 — Planets & terrain** ✅ cube-sphere quadtree-LOD terrain with **ridged-multifractal mountains** + domain warp + **per-LOD band-limited detail** + **slope-aware biome colouring**, skirts, per-patch floating origin, frame-riding, descend & land with no jitter; **ocean worlds** (rugged sea floor + translucent water surface + coastlines); **moons**; **volumetric (Rayleigh + Mie) atmospheres**; **live tuning HUD** with `tuning.json` save/load
- **M4 — Rover** ✅ drivable surface vehicle: per-planet gravity, terrain-following + slope tilt, ledge falls/landings, throttle/steer driving under a third-person chase camera (`R` to deploy/exit); arcade-grounded, pure testable sim
- **M5 — Fidelity** (in progress) — **distant-galaxy backdrop** ✅ (a deterministic far-field dome of background stars concentrated on the galactic plane + a fullscreen Milky-Way band with dust lanes and a central bulge, drawn behind the streamed star field, with live brightness knobs saved to `tuning.json`); **smooth terrain LOD** ✅ (continuous fractional-octave detail fade + geomorphing between levels + merge hysteresis, so the surface no longer pops/rebuilds across LOD transitions); **planetary rings** ✅ (gas/ice giants get a deterministic banded annulus in their tilted equatorial plane — procedural radial bands with Cassini-like gaps, sunlit and translucent, with the planet casting a real shadow across the ring); **threaded terrain generation** ✅ (patch meshes baked on a background worker pool, uploaded on the render thread, so descending to a surface no longer stalls the frame — bakes are several× faster via one-pass fine+coarse height sampling, a shared crater field, and a speculative descent that keeps the pool saturated instead of advancing one LOD level per frame); **crisp near-surface detail** ✅ (procedural surface detail is keyed to the mesh resolution rather than the pixel footprint, so the ground stays textured right up to the camera instead of blurring out on the nearest patches); **proximity speed limiter** ✅ (continuous distance-based slowdown near stars, planets and moons — unlimited in open space, with anti-tunnelling so you can't skip through a body; stars now begin reeling you in from much farther out on a gentler dedicated approach rate, so you ease in rather than zip past); **tiled star catalog** ✅ (the foreground field is a **distance-paged lattice** of spatially-indexed star blocks — billions of stars addressable, only a few million resident, blocks generated/evicted around the camera; each star keeps a stable, invertible catalog id, so search-by-number and jump-to-star load any block on demand, and per-block re-centring removes the floating-point jitter the single block had far from the origin); **rover terrain-follow & suspension** ✅ (a CPU collision mesh of the drawn triangles pins the rover to the visible surface — no float, no LOD-feedback bounce — with ground-stick over crests/dips, plus a damped-kinematic **per-wheel suspension** so each wheel travels independently in its well while the chassis bobs and rocks); **sun glow** ✅ (the active system's star stays a bright point from across the system); **HUD toggle** ✅ (`H` hides all on-screen UI); **composition-driven atmospheres** ✅ (colour + thickness derived from the scanned chemistry — scale height from mean molar mass, Rayleigh strength from gas refractivity, absorption tint from coloured gases like methane, and a Mie haze layer from haze gases + suspended surface dust, with surface pressure modelled and shown in the scanner); still to come: planet rotation, erosion & more biomes, animated water
